    <p>After representing Uruguay at various youth levels, Núñez was called up to the senior national team for his first time in 2019. He scored on his international debut against Peru. After missing the 2021 Copa América due to an injury, Núñez represented Uruguay at the 2022 FIFA World Cup and the 2024 Copa América.</p>
    <p>Early life
        Darwin Gabriel Núñez Ribeiro[4] was born on 24 June 1999[1] in Artigas, Artigas Department.[5] He was born into an impoverished family, in which his father Bibiano Núñez was a builder and his mother Silvia Ribeiro was a hawker of milk bottles. Núñez played for local clubs La Luz and San Miguel before being scouted at the age of 14 by former Uruguay international José Perdomo, and then moving by himself to the capital city Montevideo to join the ranks of Peñarol.[6][7]
        
        Struggling with homesickness, Núñez returned to his hometown to spend time with his family and went back to Peñarol a year later. At the age of 17, he suffered a cruciate ligament injury that ruled him out for over a year and required two operations.[8] While he was injured, his older brother Junior quit the club and gave up football in order to provide for the family, telling him "you're better suited than me".[6][7]</p>
        <p>Club career
            Early career
            He made his first-team debut in the Primera División on 22 November 2017, when he came on for Peñarol as a second-half substitute for Maxi Rodríguez in a 2–1 away loss against River Plate Montevideo.[9] The following month, he had knee surgery for a second time.[8] Núñez scored his first professional goal on 13 October 2018, with the opener in a 2–0 home win over Fénix.[10] On 14 July 2019, he scored a hat-trick in a 4–0 victory against Boston River.[11]
            
            On 29 August 2019, Spanish Segunda División club Almería announced the signing of Núñez on a five-year contract,[12] for a rumoured club record fee of US$4.5 million plus $1.5 million in variables.[13] He made his debut on 3 October as a half-time substitute in 4–2 league defeat against Sporting Gijón.[14] On 27 October 2019, starting for the first time, Núñez scored first goal for his new club in a 3–2 home win against Extremadura with a penalty.[15] He finished his only season at the Estadio de los Juegos Mediterráneos as the league's joint fourth top scorer with 16 goals, led by compatriot Cristhian Stuani.[16] Núñez scored these 16 goals in twice as many appearances.[17]</p>
            <p>Benfica
                On 4 September 2020, Núñez signed a five-year contract with Portuguese club Benfica, who paid a club record fee of €24 million for the player. This was also Almeria's and the Segunda División's biggest transfer, with the club also receiving 20% of a future transfer.[18]

                Eleven days later, he made his debut for the club in a 2–1 loss against PAOK for the 2020–21 UEFA Champions League third qualifying round replacing Pedrinho in the 65th minute of the game.[19] With his assist in a 3–0 win over Rio Ave on 18 October, he reached five assists in his first four league games, best in the league.[20] On 22 October, he scored his first goals for the club with a hat-trick against Lech Poznań in a 4–2 away victory in a 2020–21 UEFA Europa League group stage match.[21] Four days later, he scored his first Primeira Liga goal in a 2–0 home victory over B SAD.[22] On 3 December, after three weeks off through a COVID-19 infection,[23] he returned to action against Lech Poznań in the Europa League group stage, scoring Benfica's second goal in a 4–0 home victory.[24] He struggled over the course of the season with the effects of COVID-19 and various injuries, and did not score for four months.[25] He scored six league goals and provided ten assists – second-best in the league – helping Benfica to a third-place finish and qualification for the Champions League third qualifying round.[26]

                In May 2021, Núñez underwent surgery due to an injury on his right knee, forcing him to miss Benfica's first months of the new season.[27] He made his return from injury on 21 August, replacing Everton in the 72nd minute, in a 2–0 away victory over Gil Vicente, being booked in the process.[28] Following back-to-back braces against Santa Clara and Boavista in the Primeira Liga, he was named the league's Player of the Month and Forward of the Month for September.[29] On 29 September, he scored his first two Champions League goals in a 3–0 home victory over Barcelona, and was named man of the match.[30] On 27 November, he scored his first hat-trick in the league as his team finished the first half at B-SAD 7–0 up, though the game was abandoned early in the second half due to insufficient players on the COVID-affected host team.[31] He added another treble on 12 December against Famalicão in a 4–1 away win, becoming the seventh player in the league to score back-to-back hat-tricks.[32] Three days later, he scored two goals in a 3–0 home win over Sporting da Covilhã to send his team into the semi-finals of the 2021–22 Taça da Liga,[33] though, while he was away on international duty for Uruguay, Benfica were defeated 2–1 by crosstown rivals Sporting CP in the 2022 Taça da Liga final.[34]
                
                On 27 February, Núñez scored his 20th league goal for Benfica in as many matches, in a 3–0 home victory against Vitória de Guimarães.[35] On 15 March, in the second leg of Champions League round of 16, he scored the only goal of an away win over Ajax, securing a 3–2 aggregate win in the process.[36] On 9 April, he scored his third hat-trick of the season in a 3–1 victory against B-SAD, bringing his total goal count for the season to 31 goals.[37] He scored two goals against Liverpool in the 2021–22 Champions League quarter-finals: one in the first leg and the other in the second leg, while his team were eliminated 6–4 on aggregate. These games caught the eye of Jürgen Klopp, with the Liverpool manager stating that he believed that Núñez had a "big career ahead of him".[38] His sixth goal of the campaign made him Benfica's all-time top scorer in modern Champions League history, surpassing Nuno Gomes' record of five goals set in the 1998–99 season.[39] On 17 April, he scored a goal and provided an assist to help defeat the hosts Sporting 2–0 in the Lisbon derby, being named man of the match.[40] In his last match for the club, on 7 May, Núñez scored a goal that was ruled out by VAR in a 1–0 home loss of O Clássico against rivals Porto, as they sealed the league title.[41] He finished the season with 26 goals in 28 league games, being awarded the Bola de Prata award as top scorer of the Primeira Liga, being named in the Team of the Year and Player of the Year.[42][43]

                    On 13 June 2022, Benfica reached an agreement with Premier League club Liverpool for the transfer of Núñez for a €75 million fee plus €25 million in add-ons.[44] The following day, the club confirmed the deal, for £64 million, with add-ons potentially taking the overall fee to £85 million at a later date, making him Liverpool's record transfer.[45] On 30 July, Núñez made his debut for Liverpool in the club's 3–1 win over Manchester City in the FA Community Shield at the King Power Stadium. He won a penalty, which was converted by fellow forward Mohamed Salah, and scored his first goal for the club with a stooping header in the fourth minute of stoppage time.[46] On 6 August, he scored his first league goal for Liverpool and provided an assist for Salah on his debut against Fulham, which ended in a 2–2 draw.[47] During the following game, he was sent off for violent conduct in a 1–1 home draw against Crystal Palace, having headbutted opponent Joachim Andersen.[48] On 12 October, Núñez scored his first Champions League goal for Liverpool in a 7–1 away win against Rangers.[49] However, Núñez received criticism during the first half of the season for missing a number of big chances in matches.[50][51][52][53] Núñez was named the Liverpool Player of the Month for November.[54]
                    
                    On 21 February 2023, Núñez scored Liverpool's first goal in a 5–2 home loss to Real Madrid with a flick between his legs in the first leg of Champions League round of 16.[55] Owing to strong performances throughout the month, Núñez was named the Liverpool Player of the Month again for February.[56] Núñez's goal against Real Madrid was followed by a brace against Liverpool's rivals Manchester United in a 7–0 victory on 5 March.[57] A minor toe injury disrupted some of Núñez's later game time, with Núñez missing out on three matches owing to this problem.[58] Throughout the whole 2022–23 season, Núñez made 42 appearances and scored 15 goals in all competitions, nine of such goals coming in the Premier League, as Liverpool narrowly missed out on Champions League qualification.[59][60] Goal called Núñez's season "mixed", noting that while he had "undoubtedly shown promise" he also had "plenty of flaws to iron out". However, it was in addition recognised by the publication that Núñez had "certainly done enough to earn the love and support of the Reds [Liverpool] fans".[61] Many also argued that it was unfair to judge him on his first season, especially on a season in which many Liverpool players suffered from lapses of form,[62][63][50] with former Liverpool player Steve McManaman calling him a "work in progress".[64]
                    
                    2023–2024: EFL Cup victory
                    On 27 August 2023, Núñez replaced Alexis Mac Allister in the 77th minute in a match against Newcastle United where Liverpool were trailing by a goal and were reduced to 10 men. He scored in the 81st minute and again in the third minute of injury time, meaning that Liverpool won the game 2–1.[65][66] On 10 January 2024, Núñez provided two assists for his teammates in an EFL Cup semi-final match against Fulham, causing him to rise to the position of Liverpool's top assist-maker in all competitions with 10.[67][68]
                    
                    On 21 January 2024, Núñez scored a brace against Bournemouth;[69] his first goal was the 100th goal of his senior career for club and country,[70] while his second made him the first Premier League player that season to register at least 10 goals and 10 assists in all competitions.[70] On 28 January, Núñez scored against Norwich City in the fourth round proper of the FA Cup, becoming the first player in the 2023–24 season in Europe's top five leagues to reach double figures for both non-penalty goals and also assists in all competitions.[71][72] On 17 February, Núñez scored his ninth Premier League goal of the season in a 4–1 victory against Brentford which equalled his Premier League goal tally from the previous season.[73][74] However, he was withdrawn from this game injured at half-time and was later ruled out for the 2024 EFL Cup final, in which Liverpool defeated Chelsea.[75][76] Núñez was praised as one of Liverpool's best performers throughout their EFL Cup campaign.[77] On 2 March, he scored in the 99th minute of a 1–0 win over Nottingham Forest, which was Liverpool's latest winning Premier League goal since records began in 2006–07.[78][79]</p>
